## Installing FluidNC on your ESP32

Unpack this FluidNC release Zip file.

Plug your ESP32 into a USB port.

At a shell prompt, cd to this directory and run one of the following commands:

To install the WiFi version:            sh install-wifi.sh
To install the Bluetooth version:       sh install-bt.sh
To replace the ESP32 local filesystem:  sh install-fs.sh

### Local Filesystem Considerations

Replacing the local filesystem is only useful for the wifi
version, since its default contents are only needed for
running the WebUI user interface over WiFi.

The disadvantage of replacing the local filesystem is that
it will overwrite any files that you might already have
there, such as FluidNC config files, WebUI preferences
and macros.  The advantage is that you will get the latest
version of the index.html.gz file that contains the WebUI
code.  Another way to get a new index.html.gz is to upload
it via WebUI from wifi/index.html.gz herein.

A good approach is to use install-fs only on your first
FluidNC installation, to start from a clean slate.

### What Can Go Wrong?

If you see an error like this:

  [9481] Error loading Python lib '/tmp/_MEIoyh8ER/libpython3.8.so.1.0': dlopen: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by /tmp/_MEIoyh8ER/libpython3.8.so.1.0)

.. it could be version mismatches between system libraries and the
precompiled esptool executable in the linux-amd64 directory.

The workaround is to run the Python version of esptool - esptool.py - under Python,
instead of using the esptool executable version.  The Internet has many tutorials
for using esptool.py .  You can find the appropriate command line arguments in the
.sh files.
